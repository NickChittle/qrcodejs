QRCodeJS
========

Project can be easily demonstrated on a Linux computer by executing src/server.sh
and navigating to http://localhost:8080/page.html on a browser.

To test that the QR encodes correctly you can right-click on the image and
download it, and decode it using an online decoder. Such as
http://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx


## To Do:

### Encoding
  - Nothing

### Decoding
  - [ ] Create good tests for error codeword correction algorithm to ensure it is working correctly.
  - [ ] If I have time, improve the image recognition algorithm.
